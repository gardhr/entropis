## Goals 
Reliable password storage has become a problematic issue in recent years. Password managers have proven to be as prone as ever to security vulnerabilities while at the same time only growing in complexity day by day. The goal of this project is to remedy that very situation: An open-source password manager based a few simple yet powerful building blocks and implemented in a variety of programming languages. 

## API
The following operations are to be supported:
- Password hashing
- Storage/retrieval of passwords via some "master pass phrase"
